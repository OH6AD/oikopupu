# Oikopupu üêá

Generates simple SNAT/DNAT peering tables for Pupu Network. Used for
routing traffic trough PupuNet even when using public IP addresses and
hostnames.

The objective is to reduce the load on Internet nodes and to provide
fail-safe connectivity to other Internet connected PupuNet hosts.

You need access to the Pupu Assigned Names And Numbers spreadsheet
hosted on Google Sheets to use this application.

NB! You need to ensure all the listed hosts provide the same services (such
as HTTP) to both Pupu and Internet interfaces.
